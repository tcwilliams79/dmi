# DMI v0.1.11 — Dashboard Transparency & Interpretability

**Released**: December 17, 2025  
**Type**: Minor release (dashboard enhancements only)

---

This release focuses on improving clarity, trust, and interpretability of the Distributional Misery Index (DMI) dashboard, without changing the underlying methodology or data sources.

---

## What's New

### Data Freshness Banner
- Displays the latest data coverage period and publication date
- Automatically flags potentially stale data (>45 days)
- Driven by machine-readable metadata (`health.json`)
- Ensures readers can immediately assess data currency

**Example Display:**
```
📊 Data through: November 2024 • Published: Dec 17, 2025 • ✅ Current
```

### Top Contributors Panel
- Shows leading inflation drivers by category
- Switchable by income quintile (Q1 / Q3 / Q5)
- Makes changes in DMI easier to interpret by answering:  
  **"What's driving inflation right now, and for whom?"**

**Features:**
- Top 5 categories displayed as horizontal bar chart
- Interactive tabs for quintile comparison
- Category labels (e.g., "Housing", "Food & Beverages")
- Contribution measured in percentage points

---

## What Didn't Change

- ✅ No changes to DMI definitions, formulas, or weighting schemes
- ✅ No new data sources added
- ✅ No impact on historical time series values
- ✅ Methodology remains identical to v0.1.9/v0.1.10

---

## Why This Matters

These enhancements strengthen transparency and reader trust, and move DMI closer to the standards expected of a public-facing economic indicator.

**User Benefits:**
1. **Immediate currency assessment** - No guessing if data is fresh
2. **Better interpretation** - Understand *why* DMI changed, not just *that* it changed
3. **Distribution-aware insights** - See how inflation drivers differ by income level
